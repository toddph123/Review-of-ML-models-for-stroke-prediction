# Review-of-ML-models-for-stroke-prediction

In this project, due to imbalance dataset, I have demonstrated different data augmentation method for stroke prediction.
<br> Undersampling
<br> Oversampling
<br> Simply Tweaking (Changing Hyperparameters)

By making use of three supervised classification algorithm: 
<br> Logistic Regression
<br> KNN
<br> Decision Tree

We compare the performance on each data augmentaion method and then see if there are any ways offered to customer as an incentive to reduce their premium.
